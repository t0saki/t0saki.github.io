Hello, I'm Wu Zhengxiao! Welcome to this page where I'll briefly introduce myself.

I'm currently a Master's student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computing, and I'm expected to graduate in December 2025, and I graduated from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with a Bachelor's degree. I have extensive experience in backend development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence algorithms. Previously, I won the national first prize in an IoT Design Competition and interned at ByteDance's AML (Applied Machine Learning) department. Currently, I'm on an internship at Luchen Technology, focusing on cloud platform development. My technical expertise includes C++, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, Git, PyTorch, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

I am actively looking for internship opportunities between September and December 2025. If you are interested in learning more about me, feel free to check out my [CV](cv/).

Driven by passion, I started programming at a young age and often keep myself updated by reading various tech news and articles, which has honed my strong sensitivity to industry trends. One of my hobbies is developing open-source projects and self-hosting various services, such as NAS, VPS, and other online services. You can check out some of my open-source projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/t0saki), check out live server monitoring on my [Dashboard](https://dash.tosaki.top/), or browse some of my publicly available services via my [Self-Hosted](navigation/).

I'm very welcome to check out my [blog](blog/) to listen to my thoughts.

Aside from this, I have a strong passion for topics like aerospace, naval warfare, and history. I also enjoy playing games like Kerbal Space Program, World of Warships, and Victoria 3.
