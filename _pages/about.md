Hello, I'm Wu Zhengxiao! Welcome to this page where I'll briefly introduce myself.

I'm currently a Master's student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computing, and I'm expected to graduate in December 2025. I have extensive experience in backend engineering and artificial intelligence. Previously, I won the national first prize in an IoT Design Competition and interned at ByteDance. Currently, I'm on an internship at Luchen Technology, focusing on cloud platform development. My technical expertise includes C++, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, Git, PyTorch, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

I am actively looking for internship opportunities between May and September 2025. If you are interested in learning more about me, feel free to check out my [CV](cv/).

Driven by passion, I started programming at a young age and often keep myself updated by reading various tech news and articles, which has honed my strong sensitivity to industry trends. One of my hobbies is self-hosting various services, such as NAS, VPS, and other online services. You can view the [hardware configuration table](posts/2024/01/new-nas/) of my HomeLab, check out live server monitoring on my [Dashboard](https://dash.tosaki.top/), or browse some of my publicly available services via my [Project Navigation](navigation/).

Aside from this, I have a strong passion for topics like aerospace, naval warfare, and history. I also enjoy playing games like Kerbal Space Program, World of Warships, and Victoria 3.
