Hello, I'm Wu Zhengxiao! Welcome to this page where I'll briefly introduce myself.

I am a Master of Computing student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), expecting to graduate in December 2025, and I hold a bachelor’s degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I have extensive experience in backend development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence algorithms. Previously, I won a national first prize in an IoT design competition, interned at ByteDance’s AML (Applied Machine Learning) department, and worked on cloud platform development at Luchen Tech. Currently, I am interning at the Advertising Technology Department of Taotian-Alimama, under Alibaba Group. My technical expertise includes C++, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, Git, PyTorch, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities in Singapore between September and December 2025. If you are interested in learning more about me, feel free to check out my [CV](cv/).

Since childhood, I have been passionate about programming and frequently read various tech news and articles, which has given me a keen sense of industry trends. One of my hobbies is developing open-source projects and self-hosting various services, such as NAS, VPS, and other online services. You can explore some of my open-source projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/t0saki), monitor my servers in real time on my [dashboard](https://dash.tosaki.top/), or browse some of my publicly available self-hosted services via my [navigation page](navigation/).

I warmly invite you to check out my [blog](blog/) to hear some of my thoughts.

Beyond this, I am deeply interested in topics such as aerospace, naval warfare, and history. I also enjoy playing games like Kerbal Space Program, World of Warships, and Victoria 3.
