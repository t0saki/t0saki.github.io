 > Before you read this, please note that this article is originally posted on [Feishu](https://va6aevvtfli.feishu.cn/docx/M7qnduKszotPUZxlRZzcIOiJnTe), and I used DeepSeek V3 to rewrite it.

## **Router: Goodbye "Snail," Hello 2.5G!**  

**Requirements:**  
- **2.5G ports** (because gigabit is *so* 2010)  
- **ImmortalWrt** (with nginx reverse proxy & ZeroTier for remote access)  
- **Reliability** (so I can travel without worrying about my home network collapsing)  

| Part | Model | Qty | Price (Â¥) | Total | Notes |  
|------|-------|-----|----------|-------|-------|  
| Mini PC | G31F with Intel 8505 (6x 2.5G ports) | 1 | 940 | 940 | 12th-gen hybrid cores, overkill for a router ðŸ˜… |  
| RAM | Used DDR5 8GBÃ—2 (from a friend) | 2 | 0 | 0 | Free upgrades FTW |  
| Boot Drive | Steam Deck's spare 64GB M.2 2230 SSD | 1 | 0 | 0 | Recycling at its finest |  
| Adapter | 2230 to 2280 bracket | 1 | 5 | 5 | Best Â¥5 ever spent |  
| **Total** | **Â¥945** | | | |  

> **Fun fact:** 16GB RAM for a router is ridiculous, but DDR5 starts at 8GB sticks. Maybe one day, OpenWRT will run AI models? (Let me dream.)

## **NAS: The Underground Data Fortress**  

**Requirements:**  
- **4+ 3.5" HDD bays** (data hoarding is a lifestyle)  
- **16GB+ RAM** (for PVE, Docker, and my bad decisions)  
- **Faster than an old i7-4790K** (it's 2024, grandpa)  
- **SR-IOV support** (because virtualized storage shouldn't feel virtual)  
- **Lives in the basement** (noise? size constraints? What are those?)  
- **Power-efficient-ish** (electricity bills are real)  

| Part | Model | Qty | Price (Â¥) | Total | Notes |  
|------|-------|-----|----------|-------|-------|  
| Mobo+CPU | Erying 13500H ITX (3x M.2, 1x PCIe x8) | 1 | 1468 | 1468 | Tiny but mighty |  
| Case | Great Wall KM7B (13-bay monster) | 1 | 190 | 190 | Cheaper than a pizza |  
| Fans | Thermalright (6x) | 6 | 20 | 120 | Cooling orchestra |  
| PSU | Cooler Master GX650 Gold | 1 | 429 | 429 | Efficient and quiet |  
| RAM | 16GBÃ—2 DDR5-5600 | 1 | 585 | 585 | Dual-channel supremacy |  
| HBA | M.2 to 6x SATA | 1 | 99 | 99 | More drives, more problems |  
| HDDs | WD HC550 16TBÃ—2 | 2 | 1688 | 3376 | Helium-filled goodness |  
| Old Drives | HC320 8TB + TiPlus SSD | 1 | 0 | 0 | Hand-me-downs still work |  
| Boot Drive | Intel H20 (32GB Optane + 512GB) | 1 | 239 | 239 | Hybrid speed demon |  
| Cooler | Thermalright tower | 1 | 100 | 100 | Keeps things frosty |  
| **Total** | **Â¥6,606** | | | |  

> **Future-proofing:** Still have **1x M.2 and PCIe x8 slot**â€”ready for 10G networking or more SSDs. Because data expands faster than my budget.

## **System Architecture: The Frankenstein Setup**  

### **Router OS**  
Custom-built **ImmortalWrt (Linux 6.6 kernel)**. The old 5.15 kernel kept freezingâ€”turns out 12th-gen CPUs need modern love. Who knew?  

### **NAS OS**  
- **Proxmox VE (PVE)** as the hypervisor  
- **Synology DSM (via Arc Loader)** for storage management  
- **SR-IOV passthrough** for the HBA card (near-native performance, full SMART support)  

### **Services: The Organized Chaos**  
- **IO-heavy apps (Syncthing, Plex, etc.)** â†’ Run directly in Synology's Docker  
- **Everything else** â†’ Docker inside an **LXC container** (NFS-mounted to Synology)  

> **"Best practices? Never heard of them."**  
> Running Docker in a privileged LXC with NFS isn't *technically* ideal, but it saves RAM and "just works."  

**Only issue?** NFS-mounted LXCs sometimes **refuse to shut down nicely**. A small price to pay for simplicity.  

**Bonus:** LXC **GPU passthrough** makes **Jellyfin hardware transcoding** effortless. No more buffering for mom's drama marathons!
